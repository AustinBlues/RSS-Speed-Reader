<p>Opening Day, I mean. Around here that means Little Mountain Baseball,
for boys and girls aged 4 to 12.  That first number’s not a
misprint; they have this thing called “Blast Ball” for the near-toddlers.
The sun was up and the colours were bright.</p>
<p>We had a parade, there were speeches and the National Anthem, ceremonial
first pitches, hot dogs at the concession stands; everything you need to make
the day complete.</p>
<p>On the third-base side of the diamond, the younger kids, with their
handlers:</p>
<img src="PS083606.png" alt="Little Mountain baseball Opening Day, 2009" />
<p>A few of them gathered at home plate, I can’t remember whether this was
singing the national anthem or reciting the Little League Pledge.</p>
<img src="PS083609.png" alt="Little Mountain baseball Opening Day, 2009" />
<p>This is during “O Canada”.  The kids have no idea what the old folks
standing proud in their uniforms are standing for, but they’ll get it some
day.</p>
<img src="PS083613.png" alt="Little Mountain baseball Opening Day, 2009" />
<p>Here’s a somewhat-older division, taking the pledge.  Where we play, it’s
pretty scenic.</p>
<img src="PS083621.png" alt="Little Mountain baseball Opening Day, 2009" />
<p>The catchers in full regalia are running out to take the ceremonial opening
pitches; one from Don Davies, our local Member of Parliament, and the other
from the local minor-league ball team’s mascot.  Don gave an admirably-brief
speech focused squarely on the matter at hand, baseball; then both he and the
oversized stuffed animal got something near enough to home plate for the
little catchers to handle.</p>
<img src="PS083645.png" alt="Little Mountain baseball Opening Day, 2009" />
<p>And then, as they all marched out, someone put the chorus of U2’s
<cite>Beautiful Day</cite> on the PA, and my heart lifted, because it was.</p>

<content type='xhtml'><div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<p><a href="http://al3x.net/">Alex Payne</a> is known by thousands as
<a href="http://twitter.com/al3x">al3x</a>.  He’s a developer at
Twitter.  I’ve been a fan since he wrote what I consider to be the
<a href="https://twitter.com/al3x/status/1050814372">single greatest tweet ever</a>
by anyone.  He just published
<a href="http://al3x.net/2009/04/04/reasoned-technical-discussion.html">Mending The Bitter Absence of Reasoned Technical Discussion</a>,
which is good, but wrong in an essential way.  Ted is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Sturgeon">Theodore
Sturgeon</a>.</p>
<p>Alex had previously, and correctly,
<a href="http://al3x.net/2009/03/03/towards-better-technology-journalism.html">lamented</a>
the quality of tech journalism.  In this outing he deplores the general
quality of online discourse.  He speaks from experience, having gone on the
record about Ruby performance issues and Twitter’s use of Scala as an
alternative; this drew the outspoken ire of the Ruby religiosos.  For a polite
example see Obie Fernandez’s
<a href="http://blog.obiefernandez.com/content/2009/04/my-reasoned-response-about-scala-at-twitter.html">My Reasoned Response about Scala at Twitter</a>.
I’m not only a Ruby fan but a Scala skeptic, and I found Alex’s 
commentary illuminating and useful.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Alex is largely wrong about the quality of online
discourse.  We are in the golden age (in my profession at least) of
high-quality well-informed analysis and insight on the things
that really matter.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, there’s a lot of flamage and stupidity too, and Alex is hardly
alone in his observation of behavior that can be called at best “tribal”.
Well, so what?  At this point I appeal to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law">Sturgeon’s Law</a>,
usually stated as “95% of everything is crap”.</p>
<p>The key thing is, you have to do some mental filtering and look at the
other 5%. The Internet helps via PageRank and friends, but
independent thinking is required too: make your own finding as to
who’s worth listening to.  It seems a low price to pay for the privilege of
being the best-informed generation in history.</p>
