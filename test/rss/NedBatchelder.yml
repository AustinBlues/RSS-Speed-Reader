  description: "<p>On Jay Leno the other night, President Obama made a joke about his poor\r\nbowling scores, <a class=\"offsite\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9EsQAcw-4Y\">saying</a>,\r\n\"I bowled a 129 â€” it was like Special Olympics.\" Much has been written\r\nabout it. I know Obama didn't intend to slight disabled athletes, he was\r\nslighting himself. But it highlights a popular misconception about Special\r\nOlympics.</p>"
