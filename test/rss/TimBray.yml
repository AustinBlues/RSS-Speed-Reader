That first number\xE2\x80\x99s not a misprint; they have this thing called \xE2\x80\x9CBlast Ball\xE2\x80\x9D for the near-toddlers. The sun was up and the colours were bright.</div>"

  description: "<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><a href=\"http://al3x.net/\">Alex Payne</a> is known by thousands as <a href=\"http://twitter.com/al3x\">al3x</a>.  He\xE2\x80\x99s a developer at Twitter.  I\xE2\x80\x99ve been a fan since he wrote what I consider to be the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/al3x/status/1050814372\">single greatest tweet ever</a> by anyone.  He just published <a href=\"http://al3x.net/2009/04/04/reasoned-technical-discussion.html\">Mending The Bitter Absence of Reasoned Technical Discussion</a>, which is good, but wrong in an essential way.  Ted is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Sturgeon\">Theodore Sturgeon</a>.</div>"
