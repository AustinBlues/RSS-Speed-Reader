			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we lived in a house, the recycling bin was just outside the back door, close enough that when it rained you could toss things into it.  Now we live in an apartment, the recycling containers are down a floor and on the other side of the complex.  So we have a recycling basket (the resused catch basket from yet another failed paper shredder) stashed behind the couch.  The recycling goes in it and it is taken down to the apartment containers every few days.</p>
<p>Reducing discarded items can mean buy quality.  After having several consumer/personal grade paper shredders die on us, we bought a small office shredder &#8211; Aptiva DX120P.  It is a 12 sheet shredder and we try to never put more than 4 sheets of paper at a time in it.  It has lasted over two years and is going strong, a personal best.</p>

While much of MarketWatch is simple-minded cheerleading and herd of lemmings stuff, I generally am impressed and informed by David Weidner&#8217;s writing.</p>

Very hard.  Generally harder than learning the correct or new information.</p>
<p>One of the secrets of learning new skills that hides in plain sight is slowing down until you can do it right.  No point in practicing doing it wrong and it makes correcting the technique so much harder later on.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Value at Risk is a group of mathematical models that attempt to quantify risk.  They yield results like, &#8220;right now, our portfolio has a 99 percent risk of losing less than $10 million over the next day/week/month/etc.&#8221;  There are a couple of assumptions behind that, that the market history incorporated in the model is representative of current conditions and the profit/loss curve is a Gaussian curve (the bell curve).  Well in a crisis, probably both assumptions are incorrect.  And even in the best of times there is the flip side of the result, i.e., there is a 1% chance of losing more than $10 million over the period of interest.  Since there are around 200 trading days per year, that means on the average, in &#8220;normal&#8221; times the losses are going to exceed $10 million twice a year.  How much more?  VaR doesn&#8217;t say. It&#8217;s a Black Swan or a fat tail risk, something you don&#8217;t expect and won&#8217;t really see coming until it is upon you.  An &#8220;unprecedented&#8221; event.</p>
<p>There is a very nice story in the New York Time on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/magazine/04risk-t.html">Risk Mismanagement</a> (free registration required).  It covers the strengths, weaknesses, and history of VaR on Wall Street.  Very helpful.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our sole computer is a 1.5GHz laptop.  It&#8217;s running a full Unix load of daemons, several Rails servers, one of which periodically grabs RSS feeds and grinds through some popularity statistics.  Many of the periodic tasks run with lower priority so they don&#8217;t disrupt interactive processing (editing, Web browsing, etc.).  Largely works until I run some CPU and GPU intensive games.  I&#8217;m running the first generation First Person Shooters (FPS): Doom, Hexen, Heretic so the CPU and GPU don&#8217;t overheat.  But those period tasks and memory hogs like Firefox mess with an enjoyable game.  I can kill Firefox, which removes its memory appetite, but saves its state so on starting it again, it restores the tab and approximate location.  I have edited the cron files to stop the period tasks, but that&#8217;s clumsy.</p>
<p>Well last week I finally noticed the forest.  Just stop the cron daemon!  And it works well.  Of course I don&#8217;t always remember to restart it, but so far nothing unhappy has happened when I forget that isn&#8217;t quickly undone by restarting the cron daemon.  Hey, I may be slow, but I get there.  Which puts me above average.</p>

		<title>Insurance &#8211; Renting Access to Reserves</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about money and other perspectives on it.  When we had a windfall to invest, we went to a &#8220;financial advisor&#8221;.  Most of his recommendations seem to start with buying insurance, life insurance, etc.  Both of us are quite capable of making a living, we have no children or other dependents; it just didn&#8217;t seem like we need insurance.  I&#8217;ve been turning the situation in my mind for several years, why didn&#8217;t we need insurance?  I knew we didn&#8217;t need much insurance and not any beyond what we already had.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve found a way to look at it that makes sense.  Insurance is renting access to reserves, a pile of money to use for accidents, emergencies, etc.  As you accumulate reserves of your own, you don&#8217;t need access to additional reserves.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Growing up in the 60&#8217;s in the San Francisco Bay Area, capitalist was a dirty word.  Certainly exploitation of our fellow human beings is not good.  But looking at &#8220;capitalist&#8221;, someone who makes money investing or lending capital, i.e., savings, instead of flinging about the epitaph &#8220;Capitalist&#8221;  is illuminating.</p>
<p>Anyone who has a savings account, a pension, a 401(k) or IRA, or owns some stocks, bonds, or mutual funds is at least part capitalist.  In fact, the middle class dream is to become a full-time capitalist, someone who gets all their income from investments, i.e., they are retired.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t plan on becoming a capitalist but we are closer to retirement than not and many years lately we have more income, even more taxable income, from savings and investments than &#8220;earned&#8221; income, i.e., from wages, honorariums, and freelancing.</p>
<p>Without someone willing to invest their capital, there are no home loans (mortgages).  The only forms of businesses are sole proprietorships, cooperatives, and partnerships.  The novel &#8220;Ecotopia&#8221; describes a society without capitalism, among other changes.  It is different and I think limiting, some things require more up front money than a individual, a family, a cooperative, or manageable size partnership is likely to have.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We rolled into the Tomales Bay, CA area mid-week.  We planned on eating dinner at the Station House Cafe.   We forgot that it&#8217;s closed Wednesday.  And the Cowgirl Cafe across the street is now out of business.  So we headed up the bay to Tony&#8217;s in Marshall for seafood. Turns out it&#8217;s only open Friday through Sunday; not sure if that&#8217;s a change or they&#8217;ve always been closed most of the week.  We are here between high seasons, an unusual time for us.  Schedules may change with the seasons.</p>
<p>We ended up grabbing some pork fried rice and Mu Shu Pork at the Chinese Chuckwagon, a Chinese restaurant-style kitchen build into a truck.  Like the &#8220;roach coaches&#8221; we see around Austin that do burgers and/or Mexican food.  Inside it looks just like a tiny Chinese restaurant kitchen with room for just one cook: woks, the big chinese wire-mesh strainers, a meat slicing machine.  All on a 30+ foot bed.  There is a small wooden stair/platform to get you high enough to place and get your order.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen it frequently before parked on a side street in Point Reyes Station, CA just north of San Francisco, CA.  The owner sniffed when I requested, &#8220;no MSG&#8221;.  This is Marin County, organic capital of the world (at least in their own mind).  I gather they don&#8217;t use MSG at all.  Nice.</p>
<p>The food was hot and tasty, but a bit heavy on the cabbage and onions.  Cabbage in fried rice is a bit outside my usual experience.  There was no wood ears (a fungus/mushroom common in Chinese food) or golden needles (dried tiger lily blossoms).  I really expect one or both in Mu Shu anything.  However, it did taste good on a foggy evening with almost nothing else open.</p>
